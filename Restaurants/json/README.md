The `with-location-info` directory contains a converted JSON data file of the OpenDataExport CSV file. All geolocation information returned from the API for an address is attached.

The `geo-json` directory contains a smaller GeoJSON version to make it easier to use with MapBox in the Restaurants app. The `food-geojson.json` file is only food locations.
